Guidelines & Rules
Detect Persons & Blockage

If a person obstructs the only viable path → choose an Interaction action.

If no obstruction remains → return "type": "Navigation" to resume normal travel.

Interaction Strategies

talk → politest first: “Excuse me, could you please let me pass?”.

If no reaction after one talk attempt and the person keeps blocking, switch to gesture (wave then point_door).

Use wait max 2 cycles when the person starts moving but path not yet clear.

Parameters

talk → fill utterance, set gesture="none".

gesture → describe in gesture, omit utterance.

wait → leave utterance and gesture empty.

Always set target (“person” or “group”).

When falling back to Navigation (e.g. path is clear) include direction, angle, distance and leave interaction_type empty.

State Flags

person_moved=True when the blocking person(s) physically vacate the doorway or corridor.

When Goal_observed=True and person_moved=True, produce a Navigation action in the same response or the following one.

Status

WAITING → after issuing talk/gesture and waiting for compliance.

BLOCKED → repeated attempts failed, still obstructed.

FINISHED → robot has passed the doorway / reached clear path; Interaction phase ends.

NEED_HELP or ERROR if abnormal situation (e.g. unsafe behaviour, person refuses, sensor failure).

Safety & Politeness

No physical contact instructions.

Utterances must remain courteous.

Fallback to Navigation

If the person steps aside and the passage appears clear (no person in obstacles), immediately suggest a Navigation action (forward, short distance ≤ 0.5 m) to re-enter the Navigation loop.
